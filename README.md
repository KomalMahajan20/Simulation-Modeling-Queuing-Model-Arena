# Queuing Model - Simulations using Arena
Background and Objective
This study has been done to apply the learning of the coursework BANA 7030 – Simulation Modeling and to analyze the working model of a Mexican Cuisine Restaurant and Bar, Drunken Tacos – The Nightlife Café, in terms of resource utilization, different wait time experience by customers during their visit.

Here in America, we are affectionate with the tasty cuisine from our neighbor, Mexico. May be because of our mutual love for topping everything with cheese, lots of cheese. American and International students love the delectable Mexican dishes like Quesadillas, Burritos, Tacos, etc.

The purpose of my project is to simulate the working model of Drunken Tacos, flow of the customer and recommend options for improvement, if feasible. The objective behind this simulation study is to assess the following parameters:
1. How long each customer waits in queue and the total waiting time for each customer
2. Total Time customer stays in the restaurant from its arrival and exit
3. Factors influencing customer service time
4. Utilization of the different staff members
5. Using additional member and comparing with the model in place
